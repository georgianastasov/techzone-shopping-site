                    <h3>About hires</h3>
                    <p>How do you get a job at Amazon? Every candidate goes through a series of interviews with several interviewers. What makes Amazon unique is its Bar Raiser Program. TechZone's evaluation process is rooted in the company‚Äôs Leadership Principles to ensure we‚Äôre hiring people who will innovate on behalf of customers, and Bar Raisers are a critical component.</p>
                    <h3>TechZone offering 125,000 full-time jobs</h3>
                    <p>In March, we announced the hiring of 175,000 roles across our operations network to help provide for our communities and keep as many people as possible working during the COVID-19 pandemic. Like other companies, we hired these individuals for seasonal roles to meet a surge in demand and, for many, there was the hope of returning back to their previous companies once states began to re-open. As the long-term picture becomes more clear, we‚Äôre providing the opportunity for 125,000 of those who came on with us seasonally to stay with Amazon and transition into a regular, full-time role beginning in June. Some may choose to return to their previous job and others may choose to stay at Amazon in seasonal or part-time roles.
                       <br><br>Regular, full-time roles at Amazon come with a comprehensive benefits package starting on day one, a minimum wage of at least $15 an hour, and access to training programs like Career Choice that make it easier to springboard into a different career at Amazon or other companies. We hope the option for so many people to stay on long-term at Amazon will help alleviate some of the ongoing burden of unemployment in communities across the U.S. as we all work together to fight through this crisis.</p>
