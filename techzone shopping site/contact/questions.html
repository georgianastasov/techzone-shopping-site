                    <p>Check that the product is eligible for return and then fill in the Product Return Form, but no later than 30 calendar days after receipt / receipt. The product must be returned in the same condition in which it was delivered.</p>
                    <h3>I do not have a certificate for warranty in parcels. How can I receive it?</h3>
